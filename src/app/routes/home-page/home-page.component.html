                Task 2 - Form is where the heart is

                The best way for a form to be accessible is to use native html inputs. We're doing that here, but the
                only indication of what the input is for is its location. Adding a label using just some text or a span
                would fix this, but the text would not have any association with its input. The better solution from
                an accessibility standpoint is a <label> with a matching for attribute. It should be meaningful
                as context can be lost by accessibility devices easily, and especially so for screen readers.

                Aside - another thing to consider with inputs is use of colour. If a red outline is the only indication 
                that somethig is awry, someone who cannot see it will be confused. This is often why you see asterisks 
                or subtext on form inputs. 

                Once you have your label, move on to the next task in src/app/app.component.ts
