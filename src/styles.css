/* Task 3a - Make like OJ and focus
    Many users use the keyboard to navigate your site. They often use visual cues such as the
    outline that happens when you focus an element. This doesn't mean they can't use the input,
    it just means that they will have a more frustrating experience because they won't know
    what is focused. 

    Many users with motor disibilities use only the keyboard. This can include tremors or other
    obstacles to fine motor control. It's also generally easier for a blind person to use just a 
    keyboard. I personally prefer to use the keyboard so this would be an issue for me as well 
    just by force of habit.

    linked in the previous exercise as well)

    Exterminate!

/* Task 3.b - Font of youth
    Reducing the font size on the body component not only affects every component without a specified
    font size, it affects reader mode as well. Reader mode can be enabled in Chrome using 
    chrome://flags/#enable-reader-mode. This could be disabled for a variety of reasons, but this is 
    probably one of the most efficient. Note that this alone won't allow you to use reader mode. Also
    note that it's called "reader view" in Firefox and is enabled by default. 

    Reader mode is one of my favourite things for researching on the web. It removes all the stupid
    clutter of advertisements and other content from the actual body of the article or site. It 
    also features a variety of settings that allow people to read how they want to read - whether that's
    colour settings, line heights, kerning, dyslexia-friendly fonts (we'll circle back to OpenDyslexic 
    and Dyslexie later), etc.

    Expunge! You should be able to use the site just like you could on the main branch. 

    Thanks for finishing exercise 1! Next tasks are in the exercise-2 branch.
