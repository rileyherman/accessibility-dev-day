### Exercise 4 - The eye of man hath not heard

Ultimately, the tools discussed in the last exercise aren't as good as having people interact with the site the 
way people interact with the site. That's what this exercise is about - we're going to use a screen reader.

There are a few good options for screen readers depending on how you access the web. Some common ones include
* NVDA (Windows only; third party software)
* JAWS (Windows only; EXPENSIVE third party software)
* Narrator (installed by default on Windows)
* ChromeVox (for Chrome; installed by default on Chromebooks)
* Orca (Linux)
* TalkBack (installed by default on Android devices)
* VoiceOver (MacOS and iOS)

Note: the screen reader reads the screen aloud. Please make sure your volume is audible and, if circumstances
require, you to wear headphones. 

I won't go into detail myself as I'm probably not the best person to instruct you on these things. For a select
few of these screen readers, I'll direct you to their tutorials. I found them pretty good. 

It's hard to navigate a computer in a totally different way so try to be patient with yourself and don't give up!

#### VoiceOver (Mac/iOS)

Like anything at the operating system level, VoiceOver is not limited to websites. To enable, press Cmd+F5. Chances 
are you haven't enabled this before, so you'll likely get a tutorial pop-up. I recommend you go through this tutorial. 
Just so you know, Cmd+F5 also turns it off.

#### NVDA

I don't have a Windows computer so I didn't try this nor the next one. I'll just direct you 
to [the NVDA website](https://www.nvaccess.org/). You'll need to download and install this one. 

#### Narrator

Narrator is the built in screen reader for Windows. Apparently it was horrible but is now seemingly actually usable. 
Again, I'll direct you to [their guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1)

#### ChromeVox

ChromeVox documentation isn't particularly fantastic so I started writing a tutorial but then I found that 
[this one was better](https://youtu.be/fpbIsN31hLM). Another handy link is [this list of shortcuts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OY6SbnnD3TeMXf_luSA1vQVHQA150Azizbh140XIMQ/pub)

#### Orca

Orca has a built in tutorial much like VoiceOver. You can find out how to get started with that [here](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2021-09-03-getting-started-with-orca/). 
Another good resource if you're stuck is [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Accessibility). It's installed by 
default on anything with the GNOME desktop. 

#### Tasks 

There are two tasks in this exercise:
* Firstly, familiarize yourself with a screen reader. Once you're comfortable, try uising it on some of the sites you
regularly go to. 
* Next, use it on this site. You'll notice that there are a few things that are hard if not impossible to do. Use what 
you learned in the previous sections (and do some searching of your own!) to make it friendlier for the screen reader.
