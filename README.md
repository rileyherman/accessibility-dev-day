# Accessibility Dev Day

### Exercise 5 - I think U2 wrote a song about this once

I think we've demonstrated that the initial design of this site is less than ideal for accessibility. The
task is this: rip it apart; burn it down; build it better. 

Instead of my ramblings, I've curated a little list of resources for your inspiration. There's a lot of 
stuff here and a lot of it overlaps so I don't expect you to watch/read/listen to all of them. 

Assuming you don't want to check out all of them, I would highly recommend the UX Podcast episode and Molly Burke. 

#### Podcasts

I love a good podcast. These are episodes from a variety of different ones.

* [UX Podcast](https://uxpodcast.com/196-accessibility-for-designers/) (there are a few related episodes mentioned at the end of the episode)
* [Presentable](https://www.relay.fm/presentable/30)

Yes, TED talks. I know. I'm sorry in advance.
