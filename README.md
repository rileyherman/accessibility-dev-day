### Exercise 4 - The eye of man hath not heard

Ultimately, the tools discussed in the last exercise aren't as good as having people interact with the site the 
way people interact with the site. That's what this exercise is about - we're going to use a screen reader.

There are a few good options for screen readers depending on how you access the web. Some common free ones include
* NVDA (Windows only)
* ChromeVox (for Chrome; installed by default on Chromebooks)
* Orca (Linux)
* TalkBack (installed by default on Android devices)
* VoiceOver (MacOS and iOS)

Note: the screen reader reads the screen aloud. Please make sure your volume is audible and, if circumstances
require, you to wear headphones. 

#### VoiceOver on Mac

Since it's at the operating system level, VoiceOver is not limited to websites. However, for this workshop we'll
use it exclusively with browser. To enable, press Cmd+F5. Chances are you haven't enabled this before, so you'll
likely get a tutorial pop-up. I recommend you go through this tutorial. 

#### NVDA

I won't go over this one in detail, but just for the completeness of a Windows option I'll direct you to [the NVDA website](https://www.nvaccess.org/).
You'll need to download and install this one. 

#### ChromeVox

I started writing a tutorial but honestly [this one was better](https://youtu.be/fpbIsN31hLM). Another handy link
is (this list of shortcuts)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OY6SbnnD3TeMXf_luSA1vQVHQA150Azizbh140XIMQ/pub]

#### Tasks 

There are two tasks in this exercise:
* Firstly, familiarize yourself with a screen reader. Once you're comfortable, try uising it on some of the sites you
regularly go to. 
* Next, use it on this site. You'll notice that there are a few things that are hard if not impossible to do. Use what 
you learned in the previous sections (and do some searching of your own!) to make it friendlier for the screen reader.
