# AccessibilityDevDay

### Exercise 5 - I think U2 wrote a song about this once

I think we've demonstrated that the initial design of this site is less than ideal for accessibility. The
task is this: rip it apart; burn it down; build it better. 

Instead of my ramblings, I've curated a little list of resources for your inspiration. There's a lot of 
stuff here and a lot of it overlaps so I don't expect you to watch/read/listen to all of them. 

#### TED talks

Yes, TED talks. I know. I'm sorry in advance.

#### Podcasts

I love a good podcast. These are episodes from a variety of different ones. They can also all be found on 
Spotify if that's a better listening experience for you.
