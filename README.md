### Exercise 2 - Do the things we all know we should

Whenever you look up accessibility on the web, you tend to see a lot of the same recommendations. We'll briefly cover those here. 

Firstly, because standards are nothing if not described in acronyms, an accessible site follows the POUR model: it is

Perceivable
    * all content is able to be perceived by all users
    * this includes text alternatives for non text elements, captions for multimedia, different presentations of content, and the ability to quickly and easily distinguished.

Operable
    * all content can be interacted with by all users
    * this includes keyboard navigation, enough time with dynamic elements, allowing animations to be disabled (especially flashing ones), breadcrumbing or any way to indicate where in the site a user is at any given time, ability to use other input modalities (for example, buttons that are large enough to tap on mobile)

Understandable
    * all content can be understood by all users
    * this includes writing text such that it can be read aloud easily, content appears and operates predictably, and users are able to get help if need be

Robust
    * all content is available to all users all the time
    * this includes validating markup, validating your site works with screen readers and other add-ons, etc.
